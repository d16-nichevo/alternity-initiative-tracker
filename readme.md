# Alternity Initiative Tracker

A tool to help [Alternity](http://www.sasquatchgamestudio.com/products/alternity/) players using the 8-Impulse Iinitiative system.

This tool is a simple web page. You can open in it any modern browser, on any device, either locally from your hard drive or from a hosted location on the internet.

Currently the tool requires internet access. Future versions may remove this requirement.

## Demo

You can see a demo [here](http://members.iinet.net.au/~nichevo/alternity-initiative-tracker/).

(This section to be filled out later.)

## Usage

* Add a new character by clicking "Add Character". New characters will appear last in impulse 1.
* Move a character to a new Impulse by dragging-and-dropping. The character will be last in that impulse.
* Delete a character by dragging it to the "Delete Character" box. (The "Delete Character" box only appears while you are dragging a character.)

## Project Status

Currently, the bare minimum functionality is implemented. Ease-of-use improvement should come gradually over time.

## About this Project

I'm a fan of the [original 1998 Alternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternity) and eagerly participated in the Kickstarter for the [new 2017 version](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sasquatchgamestudio/alternity-2017-a-science-fiction-roleplaying-game).

While generally pleased with the resulting system, I've never really liked the new initiative system. You can read more about my gripes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alternity2018/comments/9n97cx).

I decided to try mitigating my problems by creating a tool that could do the work for me. I published it here so other GMs could make use of it.
